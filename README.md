# ELASTomics

ELASTomics (electroporation-based lipid bilayer assay for surface tension and transcriptomics) is an approach for profiling the physical properties of plasma membranes and gene expression of single cells. To use this package, you will need the R statistical computing environment and several packages available through Bioconductor and CRAN.
